You are a senior frontend designer + developer.

Goal:
Create a personal portfolio website using the content from my uploaded CV.
The portfolio must feel:
- Minimalist
- Bold
- Premium
- Dark-themed
- Technical yet artistic

Design Language:
- Dark theme as default (near-black background, not pure black)
- Accent colors: neon cyan, electric purple, soft teal, or neon green (use sparingly)
- High contrast typography
- Clean spacing, strong hierarchy
- Subtle glow effects on hover (very minimal, not flashy)
- Smooth micro-animations (fade, slide, underline reveal)

Typography:
- Headings: Modern sans-serif (Inter, Poppins, or Space Grotesk)
- Body: Clean readable font (Inter / DM Sans)
- Use font-weight contrast instead of many colors

Layout Structure:
1. Hero Section
   - Name in bold large text
   - Short powerful one-liner tagline (derived from CV)
   - Minimal background gradient or noise texture
   - Call-to-action buttons: "Projects", "Resume", "Contact"

2. About Section
   - Short, crisp summary generated from CV
   - Focus on curiosity, engineering mindset, and ambition
   - Avoid long paragraphs

3. Skills Section
   - Group skills into categories:
     - Electronics & Embedded Systems
     - Robotics & ROS
     - AI / ML / Data Science
     - Programming & Tools
   - Use cards or minimal pill-style tags

4. Projects Section (VERY IMPORTANT)
   - Highlight key projects from CV
   - Each project card should include:
     - Title
     - 1–2 line problem statement
     - Tech stack used
     - Outcome / learning
   - Dark cards with subtle borders or glow on hover

5. Experience / Research / Competitions (if applicable)
   - Timeline or clean stacked layout
   - Focus on impact, not descriptions

6. Education Section
   - Clean and minimal
   - Highlight degree, institution, CGPA

7. Contact Section
   - Minimal form OR simple email + socials
   - Icons only (GitHub, LinkedIn, Email)

UI / UX Requirements:
- Fully responsive (mobile-first)
- Smooth scrolling
- Hover effects only where meaningful
- No clutter, no unnecessary animations

Tech Stack:
- HTML + CSS + JS OR React (choose best)
- Use Tailwind CSS if possible

- Optimized for performance

Theme Mood Keywords:
“Calm intelligence”, “Quiet confidence”, “Engineer with vision”, “Future-focused”

Extra:
